        <h1>How Singing Keeps Me Going</h1>
        <p>
            At the age of 5 years old, there was a children’s choir that my mom wanted me to join. I was introduced to singing by my church, Redeemed Christian Church of God Winners Chapel. 
            After joining, the choir director had us sing every month during children’s week and during our Christmas concerts. 
            We were like a mini choir and had outfits for our performances and all. At first, when my mom made me join, I did 
            not think I would like it, but this choir was the start of my love for singing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a child, I always loved listening to music, so joining the choir was not my first time in music. Growing up as a Nigerian, 
            I listened to a lot of Nigerian Gospel and would memorize words and all songs. My mom would be one of the people who served 
            as an inspiration to me in the beginning. My first choir director was definitely an inspiration to me as a singer because 
            she made me better. As I grew older and started listening to more genres of music, artists like Lauryn Hill, who is my favorite, 
            and more were my inspirations. My inspiration for singing today comes from God. Since my first time in the choir at church when 
            I was 5, I have continued to be in the choir even till now. Adults in the church have grown to love my voice and singing skills. 
            I’m always hearing them say that I should continue to sing and that this is my praise to God. I can absolutely say that I agree 
            with them because singing keeps me going. With me being a Christian, when life may seem hard, God is what keeps me going. 
            My singing is my worship of God and just being thankful to live each day.
